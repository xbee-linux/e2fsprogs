  Short Descriptions
    badblocks:  Searches a device (usually a disk partition) for bad blocks
    chattr: Changes the attributes of files on an ext2 file system; it also changes ext3 file systems, the journaling version of ext2 file systems
    compile_et: An error table compiler; it converts a table of error-code names and messages into a C source file suitable for use with the com_err library
    debugfs: A file system debugger; it can be used to examine and change the state of an ext2 file system
    dumpe2fs: Prints the super block and blocks group information for the file system present on a given device
    e2freefrag: Reports free space fragmentation information
    e2fsck: Is used to check, and optionally repair ext2 file systems and ext3 file systems
    e2image: Is used to save critical ext2 file system data to a file
    e2label: Displays or changes the file system label on the ext2 file system present on a given device
    e2mmpstatus: Checks MMP status of an ext4 filesystem
    e2scrub: Checks the contents of a mounted ext[234] filesystem
    e2scrub_all: Checks all mounted ext[234] filesystems for errors
    e2undo: Replays the undo log undo_log for an ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem found on a device [This can be used to undo a failed operation by an e2fsprogs program.]
    e4crypt: Ext4 filesystem encryption utility
    e4defrag: Online defragmenter for ext4 filesystems
    filefrag: Reports on how badly fragmented a particular file might be
    fsck.ext2: By default checks ext2 file systems and is a hard link to e2fsck
    fsck.ext3: By default checks ext3 file systems and is a hard link to e2fsck
    fsck.ext4: By default checks ext4 file systems and is a hard link to e2fsck
    logsave: Saves the output of a command in a log file
    lsattr: Lists the attributes of files on a second extended file system
    mk_cmds: Converts a table of command names and help messages into a C source file suitable for use with the libss subsystem library
    mke2fs: Creates an ext2 or ext3 file system on the given device
    mkfs.ext2: By default creates ext2 file systems and is a hard link to mke2fs
    mkfs.ext3: By default creates ext3 file systems and is a hard link to mke2fs
    mkfs.ext4: By default creates ext4 file systems and is a hard link to mke2fs
    mklost+found: Used to create a lost+found directory on an ext2 file system; it pre-allocates disk blocks to this directory to lighten the task of e2fsck
    resize2fs: Can be used to enlarge or shrink an ext2 file system
    tune2fs: Adjusts tunable file system parameters on an ext2 file system
    libcom_err: The common error display routine
    libe2p: Used by dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr
    libext2fs: Contains routines to enable user-level programs to manipulate an ext2 file system
    libss: Used by debugfs
